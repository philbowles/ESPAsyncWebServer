# ESPAsyncWebServer 

This is a patched fork of [ESPAsyncWebserver](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer).

It is *required* for my repo [H4Plugins](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins) in preference to the standard (buggy) version.

The original contains a number of "features" (I'm trying to be polite :) ) which prevent successful use in some circumstances. This version either removes the "features" which break the library in those circumstances and fixes other bugs that prevent it working *at all* in some cases.

You may ask *"why haven't you informed the author and requested fixes?"* and it's a good question. I have. Several times. I have not only diagnosed the bugs, but provided fixes to them, so if you are genuinely interested, you should be asking the author why he hasn't incorporated them. If he *had* this fork would not be needed! If/when he does, I will obviously delete this repo.
